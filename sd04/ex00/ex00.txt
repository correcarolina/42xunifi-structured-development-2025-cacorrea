1. open the file ---> error: write a message

2. load the file into a matrix: the matrix contains cleaned input in uppercase

3. print a message for user: press ^X for exit the program

4. print a message for user: choose camp:	1 search by title 
						2 search by author

5. print a message for user: what are you looking for? ---> if only spaces or enter, print 
									a message again

6. transform in uppercase the string received

7. search for the substing in the column's strings of the matrix 
			---> not found: print a message
			---> found: print all the matching results

8. if received exit ---> free and clean resources and exit the program




2. create the matrix:
count the number of lines
malloc the struct of size 100 x 3 if nb of lines >= 100
		or nb of lines x 3 if nb of lines < 100
char *matrix[n of lines (max 100)][3]
read one line at the time:
	split it by commas ,
	if there are not 3 strings (id number, title, author) discard the line
	trim spaces and tabs
	transform in uppercase



possible improvement:
-create 2 matrixes: 
first ordered by title
second ordered by author 
for search use the one is required by the user's camp
-if file is longer than 100 lines:
make run the program 100 lines at a time, when finish, save the user input an load
the next 100 lines ...
